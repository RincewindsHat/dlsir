# DLSir - Configuration-management server for OpenStage devices

This repo contains a early, somewhat hacky config-management server for OpenStage phones.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This software will reconfigure your phones - use at your own risk!**
> An unmodified version of config skeleton will not fit your needs - make sure to adopt the configuration to your setup.


Limitations:
 * no support for chunking
 * only tested against OpenStage 40 phones
